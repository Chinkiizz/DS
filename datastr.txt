What is Data Structure?
 Data structure is a basically defined as a collection of data items that perform certain operations on it.
Doing these operations efficiently is our main goal.

Where do these operations take place?
If you have even the slightest idea about the computer organization then you must know that these operations obviously take place in the main memory.

So, next you'd be thinking how a program file on your pc utilises data?
 Whenever you click on any application, say MS Word your laptop opens the application for you, but in the backend there exists a MS word file which resides in the HDD(hard disk i.e the secondary memory).
This MS Word file will be brought into the main memory for execution.
Data structures resides on the main memory, without it no application architecture is possible.
